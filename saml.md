# Configuring SAML-Redirect Authentication

SAML, or Security Assertion Markup Language, is a standard for exchanging authentication and authorization data between security domains.

NativeScript Sidekick gives you the ability to connect to enterprise authentication providers via SAML. In this article weâ€™ll look at the various data points NativeScript Sidekick needs to make the connection, and then look at a concrete example of a sample connection using Microsoft Azure.

## Configuring your connection

The first thing you need to do to configure a SAML-Redirect connection is to visit the **Enterprise Auth** screen and select the **SAML-Redirect** radio button. You should see a form that looks like this.
